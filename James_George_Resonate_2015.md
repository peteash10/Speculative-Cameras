Flusser: Constrained by limitations of camera apparatus. No new information is created. Experimental photographer is one who is conscious of the camera and works to subvert it. Then free to create images outside of the existing program.

Bruce Sterling's camera of the future. Absorbs all the photons in the room, then calculates a picture from that information.

The weight of a photograph has a physical connection with reality. Kinect images were divorced from reality. 

How can an artist who works with code create a self portrait? 

Other works:
- Postcards from Google Earth - Clement Valla. Reveals structure through failing in interesting ways
- Sophie Kahn - Triple Portrait of E. Portrait moves during scanning process which is then 3d printed. Industrial	 engineering scanner. 
- Memex | Duologue Music Video. MLF&A Studio. Photogrametry. 
- Heather Dewey-Hagborg - Stranger Visions. Using DNA from found hair to recreate a visual idea of that person. 

Many photos often make one "image". Maybe the photograph as a unit is becoming irrelevant. Now in aggregate.  

Look for people who don't think they are "photographers" but whose practice is effectively photography. 

Exquisite City workshop. "Elaborate cadaver"

Programme to 3d scan objects: Photoscan.

3D scans used to built city in Unity. 

Must investigate Unity. 

Future camera maybe allows us to take photos of things that don't exist.
