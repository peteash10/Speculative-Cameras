# Notes from my studio wall

Vernacular Photography looks to the future. Professional photography is obsessed with the past. 

Photography is the annihilation of time and space. Internet is the bypassing of time and space. Photography on the internet is...

What prefixes to "of time and space" could there be? 

- Rearrangement
- Compression
- Annihilation
- Bypassing
- Aggregation
- Mediation
- Control
 
A photograph is a choice of facts, or maybe an annihilation of facts along with time and space? 

Photography is the erasure of truth and context masquerading as objective representation. 

A photograph represents nothing more than the desire to represent something. 

Focus has a multiplicity of meanings.

- Focussing light to a point.
- Focussing an image to sharpness.
- Focussing attention to a specific subject (through composition / exclusion).

Focus is at the expense of "all seeing". Brings clarity through exclusion. 

Developments in photography are historically driven by commercial and industrial imperatives. Fox-Talbot's paper was more commercial than the Daguerreotype, so won. 

Commercial developments lead to aesthetic and social developments. Front-facing camera for video-calling lead to selfies.

## POWER

*Some notes on power in photography, in no particular order*

Portraiture as a historical symbolism of power. 

Technological power:

- Apple / Samsung
- Nikon / Canon
- Sony (sensors)
 
Production / Distribution power:

- Kodak
- Facebook / IG
- Galleries
- Print / Advertising
 
Where does vernacular photography sit in relation to power? 

The Photographer as a wielder of power. eg David Bailey.

<u>How can photographic power be neutered?</u>

Definition of Power:

- Freedom
- Ability
- Capacity
- Authority
- No limitations on the above
 
Control of cameras themselves

- How are public cameras controlled? 
- How are private cameras controlled? 
 
**Making political camera art**

Target professionalism. Corrupt authority. 

Reveal power structures inherent in the process of making work.

- Authorship
- Technology
- Privilege
- Access
- Resources
- Networks
 
Enable the view to apply this to other areas of society. If photography is compromised by abuse of power through X, how is abuse of X compromising in other contexts?

Destroy photography.
